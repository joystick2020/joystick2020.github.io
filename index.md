# About

I'm now working as a Software Engineer.

From 2014 to 2016 I worked as a security consultant at
[Emaze](http://blog.emaze.net/), a small security company based in Milan,
Italy. My main activities include: vulnerability detection and exploitation,
penetration testings, source code auditing, reverse engineering, and training
courses. <br><br>

On March 2014, I got a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Universit&agrave; degli
Studi di Milano, where I mainly worked in the
[LaSER](http://security.di.unimi.it/)(systems and network security lab). My
Ph.D. thesis is titled "*Hardware-assisted Virtualization and its Applications
to Systems Security*", and is available
[here](http://air.unimi.it/bitstream/2434/233326/2/phd_unimi_r09034.pdf)
(official) and [here](stuff/phd.pdf) (w/ revisions). <br><br>

I got my M.Sc. degree in Information and Communication Technologies on October
22nd, 2010, at Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Milano, with a final grade of
110/110 _cum laude_. My M.Sc. thesis was titled "*Analisi di codice kernel
tramite virtualizzazione hardware-assisted*" available
[here](stuff/thesis2.pdf) (italian only).
