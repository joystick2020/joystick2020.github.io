- title: HyperDbg
  url: http://code.google.com/p/hyperdbg/
  desc: HyperDbg is a kernel debugger that leverages hardware-assisted
        virtualization. More precisely, HyperDbg is based on a minimalistic
        hypervisor that is installed while the system runs. Compared to
        traditional kernel debuggers (e.g., WinDbg, SoftIce, Rasta R0 Debugger)
        HyperDbg is completely transparent to the kernel and can be used to
        debug kernel code without the need of serial (or USB) cables.
