- title: HyperDbg
  url: http://code.google.com/p/hyperdbg/
  desc: HyperDbg is a kernel debugger that leverages hardware-assisted
        virtualization. More precisely, HyperDbg is based on a minimalistic
        hypervisor that is installed while the system runs. Compared to
        traditional kernel debuggers (e.g., WinDbg, SoftIce, Rasta R0 Debugger)
        HyperDbg is completely transparent to the kernel and can be used to
        debug kernel code without the need of serial (or USB) cables.

- title: CopperDroid

  desc: CopperDroid is an analysis framework to automatically perform
        out-of-the-box dynamic behavioral analysis of Android
        malware. CopperDroid uses a unified analysis to characterize low-level
        OS-specific (e.g., writing to a file) and high-level Android-specific
        behaviors (e.g., sending an SMS, placing a phone call). In addition,
        CopperDroid features a stimulation technique to improve code coverage,
        aimed at triggerring additional behaviors of interest.

- title: Fuzztrace
  url: https://github.com/rpaleari/fuzztrace
  desc: I collaborate with the open source project FuzzTrace, a
        "general-purpose" tracing tool for closed-source applications, aimed at
        generating a concise execution trace that can be used to support the
        fuzz-testing activity or other analyses.
